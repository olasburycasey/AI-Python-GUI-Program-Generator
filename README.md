# Python GUI program generator

## Overview

A project that runs generated GUI applications and intends to run them on your own.


## Instructions

1. Run gemini_2-0_flash_run.py
2. You will get a welcome message with instructions on what you want to do. The program asks you to type a number between 1 and 3.
3. If you select option 1, the program will ask you if you want the LLM to generate an image, or a game, and then it will ask you for a description of the image/game.
4. If you select option 2, the program will print a list of programs already saved that you want to generate.
5. If you select option 3, the program will print a goodbye message and automatically stop running.
6. For options 1 and 2, you will run a generated GUI program and once it is done, the output will ask if you would like to add some features or edits to the GUI program.
7. If the generated GUI program is new, you will be given the option to save the file under the saved_programs directory.
8. If the generated GUI program was saved before, the new generated code will be modified under the same python file. The new features are automatically saved.
